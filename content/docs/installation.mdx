---

## Requirements

- [Tailwind CSS v3.x](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

## Package

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss-jun-layout
```

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
// tailwind.config.js;
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require("tailwindcss-jun-layout"),
  ],
};
```

Now, type `jun-` in the class. If you see the autocompletion like the image below, you are good to go.
