---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Tailwind CSS v3](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [v4-beta](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss-jun-layout
```

### Tailwind CSS v3

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
// tailwind.config.js;
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require("tailwindcss-jun-layout"),
  ],
};
```

### Tailwind CSS v4

Use the new [`@plugin` directive](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta#using-plugins) in your main CSS file:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@plugin "tailwindcss-jun-layout";
```

## IntelliSense

After completing the installation, type `jun-` in a class. If you see the autocompletion like the image below, you are good to go.
