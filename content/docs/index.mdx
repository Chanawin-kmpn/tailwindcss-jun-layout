description: A Tailwind CSS plugin that empowers you to build fully flexible layout systems for any project.

Jun Layout is a powerful Tailwind CSS plugin designed to make building complex layouts simple and intuitive. It provides a comprehensive set of utility classes that help you create flexible, responsive layouts without writing custom CSS.

## Why Jun Layout?

Building consistent layouts across an entire application can be challenging. While Flexbox and Grid are powerful, they often require writing custom CSS classes or complex combinations of utilities. Jun Layout solves this by providing:

- **Dynamic layout patterns** - building block classes for any project size
- **Responsive by default** - All components automatically adapt to different screen sizes
- **Flexible and composable** - Mix and match components to create any layout you need
- **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box with Tailwind CSS
- **Lightweight** - Adds minimal CSS to your bundle

## Philosophy

I build this project with a "CSS-first" philosophy, meaning it relies almost entirely on pure CSS rather than JavaScript. This approach makes it framework agnostic, performant without JavaScript overhead, and simple to integrate with just utility classes. The CSS-based foundation provides reliable cross-browser compatibility and progressive enhancement, with layouts working even if JavaScript is disabled. The minimal JavaScript used is only for optional features like responsive drawer menus, keeping the core layout functionality purely CSS-based.
