By using flexible grids, adaptable images, and\n              media queries, developers can create interfaces that seamlessly\n              adjust across different screen sizes. This approach has become\n              increasingly important as mobile devices continue to dominate web\n              traffic.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              User experience design focuses on creating meaningful interactions\n              between users and products. Through careful consideration of user\n              behavior, feedback mechanisms, and intuitive navigation patterns,\n              designers can craft experiences that are both efficient and\n              enjoyable. The best designs often appear simple on the surface\n              while hiding complex considerations beneath.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\n              Accessibility in web design is not just a feature but a\n              fundamental requirement. It ensures that digital content and\n              functionality are available to everyone, including people with\n              disabilities. This includes considerations for screen readers,\n              keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and clear content\n              hierarchy. By building with accessibility in mind, we create a\n              more inclusive digital environment.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Performance optimization remains a critical aspect of modern web\n              development. From code splitting and lazy loading to efficient\n              asset management and caching strategies, developers must carefully\n              balance feature richness with loading times. Fast-loading websites\n              not only provide better user experience but also contribute to\n              higher engagement rates and improved search engine rankings.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"jun-insetSidebar jun-insetSidebar-absolute jun-insetSidebar-w-[220px] lg:jun-insetSidebar-w-[240px]\">\n            <div className=\"jun-insetContent\">\n              <div className=\"my-3 pl-3 border-l\">Inset content</div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </main>\n        <footer className=\"jun-footer\">\n          <div className=\"jun-insetAvoidingView\">\n            <div className=\"p-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground\">\n              <div className=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n                <div>Â© 2024 Company Name</div>\n                <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n                  <a href=\"#\" className=\"hover:text-foreground\">\n                    Terms\n                  </a>\n                  <a href=\"#\" className=\"hover:text-foreground\">\n                    Privacy\n                  </a>\n                  <a href=\"#\" className=\"hover:text-foreground\">\n                    Contact\n                  </a>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </footer>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n",
